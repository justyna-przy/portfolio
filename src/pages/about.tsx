            I&apos;m currently studying Immersive Software Engineering, a unique
            and hands-on software engineering degree that blends academics with
            real-world industry experience. The program leads to an integrated
            BSc/MSc in just four years and is built around learning by
            doing‚Äîhalf of our time is spent on campus working in teams on
            projects, and the other half in paid residencies with top tech
            companies.
            <br />
            <br />
            So far, I‚Äôve completed residencies at Stripe and Analog Devices,
            where I worked on everything from frontend/backend development to
            embedded AI research. My ISE class projects have included a smart
            chessboard with live piece detection, a real-time device metrics
            collection app, an Irish bird classification neural network, and
            several interactive web and game applications. Currently, I&apos;m
            averaging a QCA of 3.9/4.0.
